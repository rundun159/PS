Hi, I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science, in SKKU of Korea.
Here I'm gonna post my solutions of some algorithm problems.
The problems would come from 
BOJ(https://www.acmicpc.net/), SWEA(https://swexpertacademy.com/main/main.do) , Codeforces(http://codeforces.com/) , etc.

Any comment, idea, question will be welcomed.
Thank you!
